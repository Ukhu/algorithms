# Same BSTs

An array of integers is said to represent the Binary Search Tree (BST) obtained by inserting each integer in the array, from left to right, into the BST.

Write a function that takes in two arrays of integers and determines whether these arrays represent the same BST. Note that you're not allowed to construct any BSTs in your code.

A BST is a Binary Tree that consists only of `BST` nodes. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its values is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None`/`null`.

### Sample Input

```
arrayOne = [10, 15, 8, 12, 94, 81, 5, 2, 11]
arrayTwo = [10, 8, 5, 15, 2, 12, 11, 94, 81]
```

### Sample Output

```
true
```
